# BrainTumorDetectionVGG
Brain tumors can be classified as either benign or malignant, and early detection is crucial for improved patient outcomes. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in detecting brain tumors through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines feature extraction techniques with VGG-16 CNN to improve tumor detection accuracy. We evaluate network performance using Sensitivity, Specificity, and Precision, in addition to the accuracy criterion. Our results show that the SoftMax classifier has the highest accuracy in the CNN based on the testing images. Our proposed method achieved a remarkable accuracy of 100% on the small scale of test data, which highlights the potential of DNNs in improving the accuracy of tumor diagnosis. This method has important implications for clinical practice, as it can assist physicians in making more informed diagnoses and devising appropriate treatment plans for patients with brain tumors. By utilizing the power of VGG-16 CNN in analyzing medical imaging data, we can obtain valuable information about the location, size, and type of the tumor. Ultimately, this can lead to more precise and effective treatment plans, resulting in improved patient outcomes.
